# 404 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **URL Inconsistency Problem**
- **Issue**: Frontend was using mixed URLs:
  - Production URL for scraping: `https://scrapy-e4my.onrender.com/api/scrape`
  - Localhost URL for downloads: `http://localhost:5001/api/download/...`
- **Fix**: Created centralized API configuration in `frontend/src/config.js`

### 2. **Backend Deployment Configuration**
- **Issue**: Flask app was hardcoded to port 5001, conflicting with Render's dynamic port assignment
- **Fix**: Updated `Backend/app.py` to use environment variable `PORT`

### 3. **Missing Deployment Files**
- **Issue**: No proper Render deployment configuration
- **Fix**: Created `Backend/render.yaml` with correct deployment settings

## Files Modified/Created

### Frontend Changes:
1. **`frontend/src/config.js`** (NEW)
   - Centralized API URL configuration
   - Uses environment variable or defaults to production URL

2. **`frontend/src/App.js`** (UPDATED)
   - Now uses config for API calls
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages

3. **`frontend/src/components/Results.js`** (UPDATED)
   - Download URLs now use production backend instead of localhost

4. **`frontend/.env.example`** (NEW)
   - Template for environment configuration

### Backend Changes:
1. **`Backend/app.py`** (UPDATED)
   - Dynamic port configuration using `PORT` environment variable
   - Added health check endpoint at `/` for debugging
   - Removed duplicate imports

2. **`Backend/render.yaml`** (NEW)
   - Proper Render deployment configuration
   - Specifies Python runtime and build commands

## How to Deploy/Test

### For Render Deployment:
1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. In Render dashboard, redeploy your backend service
3. The backend should now properly use Render's assigned port

### For Local Development:
1. Create `frontend/.env` file with:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001
   ```
2. Run backend: `cd Backend && python app.py`
3. Run frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`

### Testing the Fix:
1. Visit your production backend URL: `https://scrapy-e4my.onrender.com/`
   - Should show: `{"status": "Web Scraper API is running", "version": "1.0.0"}`
2. Test the scraping endpoint with a POST request to `/api/scrape`
3. Test download functionality after scraping

## Root Cause of 404 Errors

The 404 errors were caused by:
1. **Mixed URL usage** - Frontend calling different URLs for different operations
2. **Port configuration issues** - Backend not using Render's dynamic port
3. **Missing deployment configuration** - Render couldn't properly deploy the Flask app

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy your backend** on Render with these changes
2. **Redeploy your frontend** on Vercel (if needed)
3. **Test the complete flow**: scraping → viewing results → downloading files
4. **Monitor logs** in Render dashboard for any remaining issues

The backend should now be accessible and all endpoints should work correctly!
